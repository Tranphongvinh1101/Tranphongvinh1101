## Hi there

Hello, I'm **Vinh**, a first-year **Artificial Intelligence** student.

I'm currently at the beginning of my learning journey, focusing on programming fundamentals and basic computer science concepts. Most of my work here is about practicing, experimenting, and understanding how things work step by step.

When something interests me, I usually try to build a small example or simple project to learn from it — even if it's not perfect.

This GitHub profile is mainly used to document my learning process as a student. Nothing fancy, just steady progress.
